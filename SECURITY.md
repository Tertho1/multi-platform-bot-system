# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Multi-Platform Bot System, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email [security@redwan.work](mailto:security@redwan.work) with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
3. Expected response time: 48 hours

## Security Measures

- JWT-based API authentication with webhook signature verification
- Data encryption at rest (DynamoDB, Google Cloud Storage)
- Secure credential management
- AWS IAM least privilege access
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning

## Secure Development Guidelines

1. **Input Validation & Data Protection**
   - Validate all user inputs and sanitize database queries
   - Encrypt sensitive data with secure key management

2. **Authentication & Error Handling**
   - Implement proper token management and secure session handling
   - No sensitive data in errors; proper logging practices

3. **CI/CD Security**
   - Dependency scanning (NPM audit) and static code analysis
   - Infrastructure as Code scanning and secret detection

## Component Security

- **AWS Lambda**: IAM minimal permissions, environment variable encryption
- **DynamoDB**: Point-in-time recovery, encryption at rest
- **Cloudflare Workers**: SSL/TLS enforcement, WAF protection, rate limiting
- **Platform Integration**: Webhook signature validation, API token rotation

## Incident Response Process

1. Detection and analysis
2. Containment and remediation
3. Recovery and post-incident review

## Security Updates

- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security patches
- Quarterly access review
